## Project Overview
This project analyzes 3,900 customer transactions to uncover shopping patterns, product preferences, and behavioral insights.  
It explores how discounts, subscriptions, and previous purchases influence buying decisions.  
Structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations highlight trends and correlations to support smarter business strategies and customer retention.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboards and reports  
- **PostgreSQL** – for storing and querying transactional data  
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for data manipulation and visualization  

## Features
- Identify spending patterns and popular product categories  
- Segment customers based on demographics and shopping habits  
- Analyze subscription influence and discount effectiveness  
- Generate clear visual insights using charts, heatmaps, and graphs  
- Clean and preprocess data for accurate analysis  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-shopping-behavior.git
   Navigate to the project folder:

cd customer-shopping-behavior


Install required packages:
